To be best in certain domain like Kivy development, R and Python data analysis. I follow some online courses that help me to improve myself. Else to be more specific in python dug in data analysis I follow Edukera program in analysis, and DataCamp to perform my self in R programming. 
[Edukera](https://www.edureka.co/all-courses?campcache=1&utm_campaign=Leadgen_TB_Feb24th-ROW_Last%206%20month&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=120878936&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zYnq__rr65Rf-aqSB8nqf0fKq3Vn6SKltjZGuDVYREKZ2_Nw-XNTTR2x5R6bGFUNFhgn3YQg0ziBDzDamY8pA29fY3w&utm_content=120878936&utm_source=hs_email) is a website which give some online courses in many domain. Then as I want to be more specific in data analytic I choose this branch to improve myself.
[DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/) is one of the best website that I meet to follow my courses in data analytics. There was  many things that I ignored when i meet this website i am very satisfy with there program and was very easy follow, easy to understand.
