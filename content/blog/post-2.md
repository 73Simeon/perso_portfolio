title: BIT football team in 2020
---
 
Each year at BIT since it opening we organize some competition calling ***Inter-School***. This competition aims is to do a marketing of BIT to be recognize by many secondary. This allow the people after they Baccalaureate to be well oriented at BIT. This Team was in 2020 when we would like to play vs ***Alpha-SANOUSSA*** secondary school which is at Koudougou. At the end of this match they win us ***2-1***. After three match we was qualified to 1/4 final but the strength of corona virus we stopped the competition and we didn't end it. Because the federation of Burkina Faso forbid all competition in the country in 5 month.
To underline our goals keeper was the best in 2019 at end of the competition and i was the best middle center player.
During the competition i didn't score a goal but i sometime initiate gaol action.
> *This year 2020 I was the sport delegate at BIT and the captain of football team*

> BIT football team was the best and we had a good collaboration when we are on the field to play against other team

As we didn't focus on football at BIT we did training two per week such as Wednesday and Saturday afternoon at 4pm to 6pm. And all the members was punctual at time.
