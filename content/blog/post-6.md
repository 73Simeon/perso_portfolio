Playing football was my dream and my passion when i was young between 4-17 old. During this period i am participate to primary competition, secondary competition. But when i knew that i can't be an other way to play and got money i am focus now on studying. But i didn't let totally to play i train myself sometime just the pleasure. If i want to play to a competition i train train myself in all case to avoid the hurting. 
 > It was a big pleasur for me to play this kinds of much this day. I was the center of the match. I distribute some excptional pass to my collaboartes
